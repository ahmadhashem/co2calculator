This application provides the service of calculating the total co2 generated by travelling from city $start to city $end using specific transportation method

Application is written in Java 8, using gradle as dependency management
Build is possible on linux/windows using gradle wrapper, so no need to have gradle installed prior to build, though java should be installed
In order to run the app, you need to have JRE 8 installed on the machine, (whether linux or windows)

Supported transportation-method parameter values are:
small-diesel-car
small-petrol-car
small-plugin-hybrid-car
small-electric-car
medium-diesel-car
medium-petrol-car
medium-plugin-hybrid-car
medium-electric-car
large-diesel-car
large-petrol-car
large-plugin-hybrid-car
large-electric-car
bus
train

"start" param should be a valid city name
"end" param should be a valid city name
Application depends on external API that requires authentication token in order to be used, this token should be defined under a system property called ORS_TOKEN.

In order to build the application in Linux, under the project dir run the following
<code>./gradlew clean assemble</code>
For windows, use the following command:
<code>./gradlew.bat clean assemble</code>

To integrate with CI/CD to run tests, use the following command for Linux:
<code>./gradlew clean test</code>
For Windows, use following command:
<code>./gradlew.bat clean test</code>

The project also exposes jacocoUnitTest coverage which could be integrated with CI/CD

Example to run the application after building it:
<code>java -jar ./build/libs/co2calculator-0.0.1.jar --end="Cairo" --start "Alexandria" --transportation-method=train</code>
You should see similar output :
<code>"Your trip caused 1.38kg of CO2-equivalent."</code>
